# Quick start

**Nile** is a pure Nim library for manipulating and generating images.

Nile is hosted on GitHub at [prideout/nile](https://github.com/prideout/nile).

## Overview

Nile's **Grid** object is a two-dimensional array of scalar floating-point data. It usually
holds one of the RGB color planes or an alpha mask, but it can represent anything you like, such
as a height map.

As a user, you'll mostly interact with **Image**, which contains a grid for each color plane.

Nile also defines a **Canvas** object for creating simple vector drawings. You can use this to fill
a region with color, or to draw BÃ©zier curves.

## Examples

### Create a thumbnail

Minify an image using the default filter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~nim
import nile
image = openImage("test.png")
image.resized(12, 12).save("resized.png")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*show a diptych here*

### Add an alpha channel

Add an alpha channel based on pixel brightness.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~python
import nile
image = openImage("test.png")
grid = image.getLuminance()
image.setAlpha(grid)
image.save("semitransparent.png")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Apply Gaussian blur

### Create a 2x2 mosaic
